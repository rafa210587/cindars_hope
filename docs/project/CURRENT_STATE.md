# Current State — Cindar's Hope

> **Primary execution context for agents.** Read this + AGENTS.md + active spec.  
> **Do NOT read:** PROJECT_LOG.md, ROADMAP.md, GDD, old refinements (unless spec requires).

## Project Status

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Branch (working) | `dev` |
| MVP code-complete | ✓ YES |
| MVP build-validated (C#) | ✓ YES — 0E/0W runtime + editor |
| Docs validation | ✓ YES — 25+ checks |
| MVP Phase 2 (Unity validators) | ✗ NOT RUN — pending human execution |
| MVP Phase 3 (Play Mode) | ✗ NOT RUN — pending human execution |
| MVP final accepted | ✗ NOT YET |

## What to Read for Implementation Tasks

```
1. AGENTS.md
2. docs/project/CURRENT_STATE.md  (this file)
3. Active spec file
4. Source files referenced by the spec
5. Immediately prior validation report ONLY if listed as a dependency
```

## What NOT to Read by Default

```
- PROJECT_LOG.md  (use only for audit/reconciliation/regression)
- docs/project/ROADMAP.md  (planning only)
- docs/refinements/  (read only if spec is ambiguous)
- docs/specs/a_implementar/reorg/  (CLOSED — do not execute)
- docs/validation/spec_mvp_closeout_*  (evidence; read only if explicitly listed)
- docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md  (broad status; read only for audit)
```

## Reading Policy for ADRs and Game Rules

- **Agents do NOT read all ADRs or all game_rules by default.**
- **Agents read only ADRs/game_rules explicitly listed in the active spec's `required_adrs:` and `required_game_rules:` fields.**
- **If a spec conflicts with an ADR or game_rule, STOP and report the conflict. Do not implement until reconciled.**
- **See `DECISION_LOG.md` for index of all ADRs and reading policy details.**
- **See `docs/game_rules/GAME_RULES_INDEX.md` for index of all game rules.**

---

## Do NOT Execute

```
- docs/specs/a_implementar/reorg/SPEC_00-12  (CLOSED per README_STATUS.md)
- docs/specs/a_implementar/spec_14a*.md      (covered by SPEC_24 closeout)
- docs/specs/a_implementar/spec_14b*.md      (covered by SPEC_24 closeout)
- docs/specs/a_implementar/spec_enemy_ai*.md (covered by SPEC_23 closeout)
- docs/specs/a_implementar/spec_cave_runtime*.md (covered by SPEC_24, also in implementados)
- SPEC_18-29 again  (already executed; Phase 0-1 complete)
```

## Conflict Resolution Rules

```
spec + roadmap conflict  → follow spec
spec + refinement conflict → follow spec
spec + CURRENT_STATE conflict → STOP and report inconsistency
PROJECT_LOG + CURRENT_STATE conflict → prefer CURRENT_STATE; report mismatch
```
